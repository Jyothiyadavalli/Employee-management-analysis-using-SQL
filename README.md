# Employee-management-analysis-using-SQL

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and analyzing a structured Employee Management System using SQL. The system was developed to efficiently manage organizational data related to employees, departments, salaries, qualifications, leaves, and payroll.

The main objective of this project is to transform unstructured HR data into a centralized relational database system that enables accurate data storage, consistency, and analytical reporting for better workforce management.

## Business Problem

Organizations often struggle to manage employee information when data is stored in disconnected systems. This creates challenges in:

* Tracking payroll expenses
* Monitoring leave patterns
* Analyzing salary distribution
* Maintaining data consistency
* Supporting informed HR decision-making

To solve this issue, a structured relational database was designed using SQL.

## Project Objectives

* Design and implement a relational database for employee management
* Establish relationships using primary and foreign keys
* Maintain referential integrity using constraints (CASCADE, SET NULL)
* Perform workforce analytics using SQL queries
* Practice advanced SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, filtering, grouping, and sorting

## Database Design

The system consists of interconnected tables including:

* Employee
* JobDepartment
* SalaryBonus
* Qualification
* Leaves
* Payroll

Relationships were created using one-to-many associations to ensure proper data normalization and integrity.

## Key Analysis Performed

### Employee & Department Insights

* Departments with the highest number of employees
* Average salary per department
* Top 5 highest-paid employees
* Job roles and salary distribution

### Qualification & Skills Analysis

* Employees with the highest number of qualifications
* Roles requiring the most qualifications

### Leave & Absence Patterns

* Year with the highest leave records
* Average leave days per department
* Employees with the most leave days
* Impact of leave deductions on payroll

### Payroll & Compensation Analysis

* Average bonus per department
* Department with highest total bonuses
* Average total salary after leave deductions
* Overall payroll expenditure analysis

## Key Outcomes

* Developed a centralized SQL database for workforce management
* Generated department-wise salary and workforce insights
* Analyzed payroll trends and compensation structures
* Evaluated leave impact on salary calculations
* Identified high-skill roles through qualification analysis

## Technologies Used

* SQL
* Relational Database Design
* ER Modeling
* Data Analysis using SQL Queries

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of SQL in solving real-world HR data management challenges. By integrating employee, department, salary, leave, and payroll data into a structured relational system, the project ensures data integrity, analytical clarity, and data-driven decision-making for workforce planning and payroll management.
